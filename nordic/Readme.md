# Firmware for Radio (nRF52832)

## Prerequisities

To program, use the [Segger Embedded Studio](https://www.segger.com/downloads/embedded-studio/) in version 5.68; the newer version now doesn't work. Programming Nordic chips require a licence. Register your computer at [https://license.segger.com/Nordic.cgi](https://license.segger.com/Nordic.cgi) to obtain it for free.

Copy complete *SDK v. 17.0.2* to the **NRF_SDK/SDK_17.0.2/** folder into Home folder. The folder SDK_17.0.2 contains folders, e.g. components, config, examples, etc. 
On Windows, the complete path will be, e.g. `C:/Users/user/NRF_SDK/SDK_17.0.2/...`.

The SDK 17.0.2 can be downloaded at [https://nordicsemi.com](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nrf5-sdk/download). You have to download this particular version; otherwise, migration to newer is required.
